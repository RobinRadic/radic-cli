## Description
radic-cli is a NodeJS module that can be embedded into other projects to handle command line input/output. 
It consists out of several other modules and brings them together, **the way i want it**. The main focus i have is user interaction like wizards and cli UIs. 

radic-cli features a stand-alone application next to the embeddable features. The stand alone application can be invoked by the command `radic-cli` and will give you an overview of possible commands.
